# Plugin OPA Auth Backend

This is a Backend Plugin for Backstage that provides an authentication backend based on Open Policy Agent (OPA).

The goal of this plugin is to enable Backstage users to use OPA as their authentication backend, allowing for more granular control over access to Backstage resources.

## This plugin is still under heavy development and is not ready for production use.
