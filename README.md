# OPA in Backstage!

Hello! :wave:

This plugin is still under heavy development.

In the end it will serve as a wrapper around the Backstage Permission framework to use OPA and Rego policies in your Backstage instance! It could be useful for:

- RBAC
- Authorization of certain CRUD events across Backstage
- Many more cool things

## This plugin is still under heavy development and is not ready for production use.
